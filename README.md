- 👋 Hi, I’m @davidomullan, a graduate of OSU with a B.S. in CSE.
- 👀 I’m interested in game develpment, to include programming and 3D modeling.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 3D modeling in Maya and relearning the Unity game engine.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on indie game development and small opportunities to build experience in programming or modeling.
- 📫 Reach me via email: davidomullan@gmail.com
